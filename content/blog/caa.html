    <div class="content is-size-5">
      <p>A recent act that has been passed by the Central Government of India is the
        Citizenship Amendment Act. For the last few weeks, many university students and illiterate people with
        good
        or
        bad intentions in mind have taken part in processions which have gradually led to riots in the country.
        I
        have
        observed that there are misconceptions in students regarding this.</p>

      <p>In 1947, our nation was split into two based on religion. Though India chose to be a secular nation
        respecting all religions, Pakistan chose to be a Muslim nation. Millions of people walked from India to
        Pakistan and vice versa. However, due to affinity, family and assets, Many Hindus and Sikhs remained in
        Pakistan and Muslims stayed back in India. The then Prime Ministers of India and Pakistan, Jawaharlal
        Nehru and Liaquat Ali Khan have assured each other that if the religious minorities want to migrate to
        the other country, they should be taken care of.
      </p>

      <p>Further, in 1971 Pakistan too split into two nations-- Pakistan and Bangladesh. Bangladesh too chose to
        be an Islamic country. Though the Muslim minorities in India have been taken care of, the religious
        minorities in Pakistan and Bangladesh have not been given the same treatment. Due to this, thousands of
        minorities such as Sikh, Christians, Buddhists and Hindus came into India. But they haven't been given
        citizenship here
        also so
        they became refugees. </p>

      <p>The Citizenship Amendment Act is an act that provides citizenship to such people who are persecuted based
        on
        religion. However, there has been a cutoff point till 2014 which means that only people who have come
        before
        that will be granted citizenship. This precaution has been taken to avoid the flooding of refugees from
        the
        countries of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan.</p>
