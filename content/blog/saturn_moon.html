    <p class="inline is-size-5 title chill"> Get to know the Night Sky</p>
    <p class="is-size-5">Familiarise yourself with the Night Sky. Go outdoors on a clear night, allow you eyes to get
      adjusted to the dark
      surroundings and then you're all good to go!<br>Gather a few Star Charts from your local library or download them
      from the internet and learn all the Catalogued Stars, Constellations. Just remember to have patience. Astronomy is
      a slow hobby and it'll take time to get acquinted with the basics.
      If you live in a densely light polluted area, here are a few Stars and Constellations that rule the night sky at
      any place on the planet. (Just remember to give your eyes enough time to adjust to the darkness of the night!)

  <p class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-grey-light inline">Step 2</p>
  <p class="inline is-size-5 title chill">First Telescope</p>
  <p class="is-size-5">Once you are confident that you have mastered the night sky, its time to buy your first
    Telescope. Now, you might want to consider shifting to a binoculars as it is quite portable as
    compared to a telescope and is easy to spot your targets, offers a wide field of view for first timers, making it
    easier to find your way around. In contrast, most telescopes offer upside-down views and it can often be confusing
    for a beginner. Binoculars are also very cheap as compared to telescopes and an ordinary 7 to 10 powered binoculars
    offer the same view as compared to an amateur telescope for just half the price. So the facts are here and its
    your decision to take. <br>
    But still as an amaeteur astronomer myself, I would suggest you to take a good, powerful binoculars such as the
    Celestron SkyMaster 20√ó80  and the Celestron 20√ó80 SkyMaster Pro. If you are looking for some good
    telescopes, then the Celestron Astromaster 130 AZ which I am currently using might be a good choice for you.

    <p class="inline is-size-5 subtitle">Important things to remember</p>
    <ol class="is-size-5 open">
      <li class="is-size-5">Aperture</li>
      <p class="is-size-5">The hole through which the light passes, usually the main lens or the mirror is known as the
        Aperture. The greater the Aperture, the greater the resolution. For beginners, a 6-8 inch telescope is ideal.
      </p>
      <br>
      <li class="is-size-5">Focal length</li>
      <p class="is-size-5">This is the amount of light the lens or mirror bends gathered light into the focus point is
        the
        focal length. The larger the focal length, the smaller the field of view. So a telescope with a
        high
        focal length as 1500 mm is best suited for viewing closer objects such as the moon or other close planets. For
        deep sky objects, a focal length of 1000 mm is optimal.</p>
      <br>
      <li class="is-size-5">Magnification</li>
      <p class="is-size-5">Although people hype about the magnification of the telescope, that's misleading. Making
        something larger isn't helpgul if the resolution is poor. Magnification is simply a measurment of
        the Focal Length of the telescope divided by the Focal length of the eyepiece.</p>
    </ol>
  </div>
  <div class="container box notification">
    <p class="is-size-5 mt title chill">Types of Telescopes</p>
    <ol class="is-size-5 open A">
      <li>Refractors</li>
      <p class="is-size-5">The classic long and skinny telescope. Refractors bend incoming light through one curved lens
        and further
        into another curved lens just before the eyepiece. This simple setup makes refractors durable and they require
        low
        maintenance, but the high-quality lenses also makes them an expensive choice.</p>
      <img src="/images/telescope_refractor.jpeg">
      <figcaption>A classic refractor</figcaption>
      <li>Reflectors</li>
      <p class="is-size-5">A great choice for beginners, it uses a two-mirror system to capture and focus light on the
        eyepiece. They usually are the best of the lot habing the largest Apertures making their resolution superb. They
        might be big and awkward, but they're most economical due to the cost per-inch aperture.</p>
      <img src="/images/telescope_reflector.jpeg">
      <figcaption>A classic reflector</figcaption>
      <li>Compound/Catadioptric</li>
      <p class="is-size-5">A compact refractor/reflector hybrid that uses a corrective lens and curved mirrors to
        greatly
        increase the focal length. Compounds like Schmidt-Cassegrains, Dobsonians are more versatile and lighter than
        reflecting
        scopes, but their four optical surfaces significantly bump up their cost.</p>

  <p class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-grey-light inline">Step 3</p>
  <p class="inline is-size-5 title chill">Upgrading your gear</p>
  <ol class="is-size-5 open ml">
    <li class="is-size-5">Eyepiece</li>
    <p class="is-size-5">An eyepiece changes the focal ratio of your telescope, thus changing the magnification. Certain
      eyepieces are better for different viewing situations‚Äîsay, looking at a whole galaxy versus its individual
      spirals‚Äîso you'll want at least a few extra. The PloÃàssl is a popular style of lens. A good eyepiece collection is
      the Meade's
      Super PloÃàssl series of eyepieces, ranging from 6.5 mm to 56 mm. When buying eyepieces, opt for a 1.25-inch barrel
      diameter, which can be used with almost any telescope</p>
    <figure class="is-centered">
      <img src="/images/eyepiece.jpeg">
    </figure>
    <li class="is-size-5">Barlow Lens</li>
    <p class="is-size-5">Placed between the eyepiece and the telescope, a Barlow lens essentially doubles the
      magnification of any eyepiece, making it a favourite of every astronomer. (But remember, higher magnification
      isn't always good!)</p>
    <img src="/images/barlow_lens.jpeg">
    <li class="is-size-5">Moon Filter</li>
    <p class="is-size-5">Finding the moon is easy. Seeing it in great detail is a bit trickier‚Äîthe brightness borders on
      blinding. Solution: a moon filter. It easily fits on any eyepiece and gives you great details of the lunar
      surface. </p>
    <img src="/images/moon.jpeg">
    <li class="is-size-5">Solar Filter</li>
    <p class="is-size-5">Observing everything has become easy with your new telescope but what about observing the Sun?
      Solution: Solar filter. A Solar filters block most of the sunlight to avoid any damage to the eyes and gives you
      cool images of the sun like this-

  </ol>


  <p class="subtitle is-size-5 has-text-grey-light inline">Step 5 </p>
  <p class="inline is-size-5"> Keep an Astronomical Diary</p>
  <p class="is-size-5">Once you are comfortable around your telescope, start keeping an Astronomical Diary. Write down
    everything you spotted from the first day and note down all the important celestial events that'll be taking place
    in the next few months. It could be short and peppy, say "November 7th ‚Äî out with the 10x50 binocs ‚Äî clear windy
    night ‚Äî NGC 557 in Cassiopeia a faint glow next to two brighter stars". Get a small pocket notebook and keep it with
    the rest of your gear. Take it out every time you use the telescope. When you've become an expert a few years down
    the lane, you'd probably like to look back on your early errors when you were just getting started on Astronomy.
