  </a>
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info">Why the Periodic Table?</p>
  <p class="comma">The Periodic Table is one of the most significant achievements in Science. <b>Dmitri Ivanovich
      Mandeleev</b>
    started working on the Periodic Table in <b>1869</b>. Since then, many people have contributed to it in various
    forms.
    It has been a staggering <b>150</b> years after the Periodic Table has come into existance. To honour it, I
    decided to
    make a Periodic Table using HTML and Bulma CSS that would give you everything you need to know about the
    Periodic
    Table. <br>You can check it out <a href="http://scientific-boats.surge.sh/index.html"><b>here</a></b></p>
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info inline">How does it help?</p>
  <p class="comma">Since I'm always working with chemicals such as Hydrochloric acid and other stuff like that, it
    always used to be
    frustrating for me to remember the Atomic Masses, Weights, Electrons, Protons, Neutrons and other things related
    to the Periodic Table. But after I started using this, it has become so easy and now after regular usage I
    remember almost all the elements in the Periodic Table.</p>

  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info inline">An easy way to remember</p>
  <p class="comma">I recently found that remembering anything is easier by memorising it like a song or a story which
    you can relate
    to than mugging it up. So, I recently came across this song which I would like to share with you that is easy to
    sing and covers all the Elements of the Periodic Table. </p>
