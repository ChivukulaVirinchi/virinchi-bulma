  <p class="comma">This assistant can open applications, search the web, Youtube, Wikipedia, and search the entire
    Wolfram Alpha Database for all of your questions. </p>

  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info">Basic Requirements:</p>
  <p class="subtitle is-size-6 comma">Getting started is pretty simple. There are just three
    prerequisites
    and then you are on your way. You're going to need-</p>
  <ul class="content" type="1">
    <li><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" class="has-text-link">Python 3</a></li>

    <li>A good text editor such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download" class="has-text-link">Visual Studio
        Code</a></li>
  </ul>
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-light inline comma">Step 1:</p>
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info inline">Installing the packages</p>
  <p class="comma">There are a few packages to be installed first such as gTTS, pyaudio, playsound etc. Installing them
    is simple,
    just run the following commands in the Command Prompt or Terminal.</p>

  <pre>$:~ pip3 install gTTS</pre>
  <p class="comma">The above command installs the <b>Google Text To Speech</b> library which will be converting what we
    speak into
    text.</p>


  <pre>$:~ pip3 install SpeechRecognition</pre>
  <p class="comma">The above command installs the <b>Speech Recognition</b> package which understands our audio and
    converts it into
    text.</p>

  <pre>$:~ pip3 install -U selenium</pre>
  <p class="comma">The above command installs the <b>Selenium Web Driver</b> package that controls and searches the web.
  </p>

  <pre>$:~ pip3 install wolfram-alpha-api</pre>
  <p class="comma">The above command installs the <b>Wolfram Alpha</b> Api which calculates everything you ask for. </p>

  <pre>$:~ pip3 install playsound</pre>
  <p class="comma">The above command installs the <b>Playsound</b> package which plays the saved audio file from your
    computer.</p>

  <pre>$:~ sudo apt-get install python3-pyaudio</pre>
  <p class="comma">The above command installs the <b>Pyaudio</b> package which 'hears' your audio</p>


  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-light inline">Step 2:</p>
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info inline">Getting started with the code</p>

  <p class="comma">The main functions of the program are the <code class="has-text-grey-dark">get_audio()</code> and
    <code class="has-text-grey-dark">assistant_speaks</code>functions. The <code
      class="has-text-grey-dark">get_audio()</code> function "listens" to the audio(What you speak) through the
    microphone, the time limit is set to 7 sec (You can change it). The <code class="has-text-grey-dark">
      assistant_speaks</code> function is used to speak out the output after the computer has processed your query.
    So now you probably understand how the assistant's going to work. If not, don't fret. I too didn't get it for
    the first time <i class="fa fa-smile-o" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-light inline">Step 3:</p>
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info inline">Random Fun</p>
  <p class="comma">We have used the <code class="has-text-grey-dark">elif</code> function so that the assistant can
    answer on
    its own
    without searching the web or anything. Examples are queries like "Who made you", "Where do you live" etc. </p>

  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info inline">And then you're done!</p>

  <p class="comma">Now you have officially finished building an AI assistant! All that's left to do now is to take it

  <p class="subtitle is-6 comma">PS: I have not included getting the google token which you can obtain from <a

    <li><b>"Where do you live"</b></li>
    <p class="is-7">To this, the assistant replies "that its stuck inside a device."</p>
    <li><b>"Self-Destruct"</b></li>
    <p class="is-7">To this, the assistant replies "Self-Destructing in 5 4 3 2 1 Boom!"</p>

  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-grey-light inline">Step 8:</p>
  <p class="is-size-5 has-text-info inline">Some important things to keep in mind</p>
  <p class="comma">You can customise the above code into your style and call it your own. Just a little experience with
    Python and a few tweaks here and there and its all yours. Customise it just the way you like it and make it yours.
  </p>
  <p class="comma">The above are just some examples to show you the power of AI and you are free to experiment.
    <br> Whenever you need the assistant to take input from the<code class="has-text-grey-dark">wolfram-alpha-api</code>
    you must include the word <b>"Calculate"</b> before the query.</p>
  <p class="comma">I have included the entire code and additional instructions in a Github Repo and you can download it
    from here.
    This file includes audio files which will be used to play the 'song' the assistant sings.</p>
